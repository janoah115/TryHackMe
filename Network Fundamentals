--Intro to LAN--

Topologies:
Star - devices connect to central network device like switch/hub
  Reliable and scalable
  Most expensive

Bus - Backbone cable used for traffic between all devices
  Easier and cost-efficient
  Little redundancy/single point of failure, prone to bottlenecking

Ring (Token) - Devices directly connect to each other to form a loop, sending data across loop until it reaches destination
  Devices will send their own data before sending received data
  Little cabling and less dependence on dedicated hardware
  Less prone to bottle necks
  Little redundnacy - one cable cut/device failure brings whole network down

Primer on subnetting:
Subnetting - splitting network inot smaller, miniature networks within itself
  Achieved by splitting up number of hosts that can fit within the network, represented by SUBNET MASK

Subnets use IP addresses in 3 different ways:
ID the NETWORK ADDRESS - address IDs the start of the actual network and is used to identify a networks existence
ID the HOST ADDRESS - An IP address here is used to identify a device on the subnet
ID the DEFAULT GATEWAY - a special address assigned ot a device on the network capable of sending info to another network

ARP:
Address Resolution Protocol - allows devices to identify themselves on a network by associating its MAC with IP address

When devices communicate to each other, they will send abroadcast to entire network searching for specific device via ARP for MAC address.

ARP cache- stores identifiers of other devices on network

ARP Request - broadcasted message asks what MAC owns this IP?
ARP Reply - device that owns the requested IP responds with its MAC address

DHCP:
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
When a device connects to a network, if it doesn't have a manually assigned IP, it uses DORA:
DHCP DISCOVER - request to find DHCP server
DHCP OFFER - DHCP server replies with a usable IP
DHCP REQUEST - Device confirms it wants the usable IP
DHCP ACK - DHCP server send reply ACKnowledging it has been completed, and device can start using the IP
