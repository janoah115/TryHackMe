---DNS IN DETAIL---

DNS - Domain name System - protocol that resolves hostnames to their respective IP address

--Domain Hierarchy--
TLD - Top-Level Domain - most righthand part of domain name - tryhackme.COM

2 types of TLD
1) gTLD (Generic Top Level) - tells user domain names purpose - .com commercial, .org organization
2) ccTLD (Country Code Top Level Domain) - geographical - .ca  Canada, .uk  United Kingdom

Second-Level Domain - before .com - TRYHACKME.com
  Limited to 63 characters + TLD and can only use a-z 0-9 and hyphens

Subdomain - left side of Second-Level Domain using a . to separate - ADMIN.tracyhackme.com
  Length must be 253 characters or less

--Record Types--

A Record - resolve to IPv4 address
AAAA Record - resolves to IPv6 address
CNAME Record - resolve to another domain name
  store.tryhackme.com returns CNAME record shops.shopify.com
  Another DNS request would then be made to shops.shopify.com to work out the IP
MX Record - resolve to address of servers that handle the email for the domain you are querying
  MX Record response for tryhackme.com would look like alt1.aspmx.l.google.com
  These records also come with a PRIORITY FLAG - tells the client in which order to try the servers.
      Good for backup server redundancy
TXT Record - free text fields where any text-based data can be stored
  Common use can be to list servers that have authority to send an email on behalf of the domain
    Helps against spam and spoofed email
  Can also verify ownership of domain name when signing up for third party services

--Making a Request--
1) When requesting domain name, computer checks local cache to see if you've previously looked up the address recently.
  If not, a request to your RECURSIVE DNS server will be made
2) Recursive DNS server usually provided by ISP that has a local cache of recently searched domain names.
  If result is found locally, sent back to computer, and request ends here
  If not found locally, journey begins to find correct answer, starting with internets root DNS servers.
3) Root Servers - DNS backbone of the internet - redirect you to correct TLD server, depending on your request.
  If searching www.tryhackme.com, root server will recognize the TLD of .com and refer you to the correct TLD server that handles .com addresses
4) TLD Server - holds records for where to find authoriative server to answer DNS request.
  AKA NAMESERVER for domain
5) AUTHORITATIVE DNS server - responsible for storing DNS records for a particular domain name & where any updates to your domain name DNS records would be made.
  Depending on record type, DNS record is sent back to RECURSIVE DNS server, where a local copy is cached for future requests and relayed back to original client that made the request
  DNS records all come with a TTL value - how many seconds that the response should be saved for locally until you have to look it up again
  Caching saves on having to make DNS request every time you communicate with a server

CLIENT > RECURSIVE > ROOT > AUTHORITATIVE > CLIENT
