---Putting it all together (web)---

Summary:
Request website in your browser > Find web server IP address with DNS > Connect to webserver > View website

--Other Components--

-Load Balancers-
Ensures high traffic websites can handle the load
Provides failover if server becomes unresponsive

Round-robin algorithm - sends request to each server in turn
Weighted algorithm - checks how many requests a server is currently dealing with and sends to least busy

Periodic health checks - if server doesn't respond, balancer will stop sending traffic until it does

-CDN (Content Delivery Networks)-
Allows to host static files from website (JS, CSS, Images, Videos) and host them across thousands of servers all over the world.
CDN sends from nearest server

-Databases-
Stores info
MySQL, MSSQL, MongoDB, Postgres, and more

-WAF (Web App Firewall)-
Sits between web request and web server to protect from hacking or DDoS attacks.
Analyzes for common attack techniques and whether its from a real server or bot
Checks for excessive requests using RATE LIMITING to defend DDoS

--How Web Servers Work-- 
-What is a web server?-
Software that listens for incoming connections and uses HTTP to deliver web content to clients

Common web server softwares:
Apache, Nginx, IIS, and NodeJS.

Web server delivers files from root directory, defined in software settings.
  Nginx and Apache use /var/www/html in Linux
  IIS uses C:/inetpub/wwwroot in Windows
    If you requested example.com/picture.jpg, it would send the file /var/www/html/picture.jpg from local hard drive

-Virtual Hosts-
Hosting multiple websites with different domain names.
Web server checks hostname requetsed from HTTP headers and matches that against virtual hsots (text-based config files)
  If no match is found, default website is provided

Virtual hosts can have their root directory mapped to different locations on the hard drive.

-Static vs Dynamic content-
Static never changes (pics, JS, CSS, etc.)
Dynamic content could change with different requests.
  Blog example
    Homepage shows latest entries. New entry updates home page, making different results.
These changes are done in Backend using programming and scripting languages.

-Scripting and Backend Languages-
Makes website interactive to users.
Examples: PHP, Python, Ruby, NodeJS, Perl and more. 
These languages can interact with databases, call external services, process data from uesr, and more

http://example.com/index.php?name=adam

If index.php was built like this:

<html><body>Hello <?php echo $_GET["name"]; ?></body></html>

It would output the following to the client:

<html><body>Hello adam</body></html>

Client doesn't see PHP code cause its on the Backend.
