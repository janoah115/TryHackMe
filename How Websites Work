---HOW WEBSITES WORK---

When visiting a website, your browser makes a request to a web server asking for info about the page.
It will respond with data that your browser uses to show the page.

2 Major componenets:
Front End (Client Side) - way that your browser renders website
Back End (Server side) - a server that processes request and returns response

--HTML--
Websites are created using:
HTML to build and definte structure
CSS to add style
Javascript to imprement interactive complex features

HyperText Markup Language - language websites are written in
Elements (AKA tags) are the building blocks of HTML pages and tells browser how to display content

HTML structure has following componenets:

The <!DOCTYPE html> defines that the page is a HTML5 document. This helps with standardisation across different browsers and tells the browser to use HTML5 to interpret the page.
The <html> element is the root element of the HTML page - all other elements come after this element.
The <head> element contains information about the page (such as the page title)
The <body> element defines the HTML document's body; only content inside of the body is shown in the browser.
The <h1> element defines a large heading
The <p> element defines a paragraph
There are many other elements (tags) used for different purposes. For example, there are tags for buttons (<button>), images (<img>), lists, and much more.

Tags can contain attributes such as the class attribute which can be used to style an element (e.g. make the tag a different color) <p class="bold-text">, or the src attribute which is used on images to specify the location of an image: <img src="img/cat.jpg">.
An element can have multiple attributes each with its own unique purpose, e.g., <p attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2">.

Elements can also have an id attribute (<p id="example">), which is unique to the element
Unlike the class attribute, where multiple elements can use the same class, an element must have different id's to identify them uniquely. 
Element id's are used for styling and to identify it by JavaScript.

--JavaScript--
JS is used to control functionality of web pages.
JS can dynamically update the page in real-time, giving functionality to change the style of a button when a particular event on the page occurs.

JavaScript is added within the page source code and can be either loaded within <script> tags or can be included remotely with the src attribute: <script src="/location/of/javascript_file.js"></script>

The following JavaScript code finds a HTML element on the page with the id of "demo" and changes the element's contents to "Hack the Planet" : 
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hack the Planet";

HTML elements can also have events, such as "onclick" or "onhover" to execute JS when the event occurs.
 The following code changes the text of the element with the demo ID to Button Clicked: 
<button onclick='document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Button Clicked";'>Click Me!</button> - onclick events can also be defined inside the JavaScript script tags, and not on elements directly. 

--Sensitive Data Exposure--
Occurs when website doesn't properly protect/remove sensitive clear-text info to end-user, usually found in frontend source code.

Sensitive info can be leveraged to further an attacker's access within different parts of a web app.
For example, there could be HTML coments with temp login credentials.

When assessing a web app for security issues, one of the FIRST things yuo should do is review page source code for exposed login credentials or hidden links

--HTML Injection--
Vulenerability that occurs when unfiltered user input is displayed on the page.
If a website fails to sanitize the input (filter any "malicious" texst that a user inputs), and that input is used on the page, an attacker can inject HTML code

1) User types info into input field
2) Input used in JS function to show the name to the page
3) No input is sanitized, so you can write your own HTML or JS and it will be used on the page

General rule is to never trust user input. Should always be santized before using it in JS
